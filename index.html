        <h1>Animation in HTML5</h1>
        <p id="firstIntro">Well you have watched many website whether it might be a
            news platform, educational or e-commerce among of them it
            is common that all of those use menu bar, navigation, events
            on scrolling infact there are icons, images which are designed
            with specific chapters of the HTML which are known as SVG
            (scalable vector graphics)
           
            <img src="D:\fourthHTML\IMG_20210929_204502.jpg" width="90%"/>
        </p>

        <h1>SCALABLE VECTOR GRAPHICS</h1>
        <p>Well these are just like other elements in HTML document like
            header, navigation in which the arts, which are created done
            with vector and these are resolution independent and we
            often use them in building the icons, images dedicated for
            something in the website and these are not used for creating
            any 3D art nor for moving vector therefore not used in any of
            the game development projects.</p>
         <h1>Path</h1>
        <p id="secIntro">
            Well this is the child tag present in the SVG tag dedicated for
            creating a perfect geometry with shape and size as its format.
            Well here are the some attributes present in the Path tag that
            decides the geometry like M(move to), L(line to), H(horizontal
            line to), V(vertical line to), C(curve to), S(Smooth line to), Q(
            quadratic beizer curve), T(smooth quadratic beizer curve),
            A(elliptical curve), Z(Close path).<br/>  
              <img src="D:\fourthHTML\IMG_20210929_204523.jpg" width="100%"/>
        </p>

        <h1>Drawing the shapes</h1>
        <p>Using the SVG we can able to draw as much of the geometry
            as we can think well built in shapes include path, boxes, circle,
            rectangle, square , line, polyline, quadrilateral, ellipse,
            polygon.</p>
            <h1>Drawing the circle</h1>
        <p id="thiIntro">
            To draw the circle we must use SVG tag as parent tag to it and
then we use width and height attribute for the SVG to access
the amount of some for the geometry and then we use Circle
tag with <b>cx, cy, r, fill</b> as attribute well cx is the distance of circle
along x axis with left end border of SVG and cy for distance
along y axis and r for the radius of the circle, fill for the
purpose of color filling and thatâ€™s all we have a circle.

<h1>Drawing the rectangle</h1>
<p id="fouIntro">
    To draw the rectangle we must use SVG tag as parent tag to it
and then we use width and height attribute for the SVG to
access the amount of some for the geometry the we have rect
tag inside we have width and height to mention about the
dimension of rectangle fill to fill the color and x ,y for the
purpose to mention the distance of rectangle from x and y
axis inside the SVG element.

</p>
<h1>Drawing the Line</h1>
<p>To draw the line we must use SVG tag as parent tag to it and
    then we use width and height attribute for the SVG to access
    the amount of some for the geometry then we have x0,y0
    attributes to mention the line origin and x2,y2 as end of the
    line and in the style attribute we are with stroke for color of
    line and stroke-linecap to mention about the shape that line
    end has to be, stroke-width to mention about the width of the
    line.

<h1>Drawing the polyline</h1>
<p>To draw the polyline we must use SVG tag as parent tag to it
    and then we use width and height attribute for the SVG to
    access the amount of some for the geometry in the polyline
    tag we are with style with stroke-linejoin which decide the
    mode of line joining then stroke to define the color of svg and
    then stroke-width to define the width of the element points to
    mention about the axis of pointed geometry<br/>

<h1>Drawing the polygon</h1>
<p>To draw the circle we must use SVG tag as parent tag to it and
    then we use width and height attribute for the SVG to access
    the amount of some for the geometry after which we have
    use the polygon tag along with the attribute points to
    mention about the axis then style to mention about the
    styling the geometry.

<h1>Shape animation</h1>
<h3>Rectangle movement</h3>
<p>To draw the circle we must use SVG tag as parent tag to it and
    then we use width and height attribute for the SVG to access
    the amount of some for the geometry then we use rect tag
    inside mention the required attributes to create the rectangle
    then we use animate tag along with the attributeName, from
    to mention about change, dur to mention about the duration
    fill to mention about the color that should present before it
    changes.
